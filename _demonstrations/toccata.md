# Presentation
Toccata is an activity-centric system for classroom orchestration. 
Through preliminary fieldwork, we identified three main challenges in the management of digital activities in classrooms: 
1. Poor infrastructures lead to breakdowns in the activity 
2. Activity structures are idiosyncratic (they vary widely and are rarely shared); and 
3. Orchestration is difficult because teachers lack an overview of the unfolding activities. 

We developed Toccata to support activity scripting and orchestration in situations with unreliable connectivity.
